abstract="Communication networks rely on time synchronization information generated by base station equipment (either the Global Navigation Satellite System receiver or rubidium atomic clock) to enable wireless networking and communications. Meanwhile, the time synchronization among base stations depends on the Network Time Protocol. With the development of mobile communication systems, the corresponding time synchronization accuracy has increased as well. In this case, the use of sparsely distributed-high-precision synchronization points to synchronize time for an entire network with high precision is a key problem and is the foundation of the enhanced network communication. The current receiver equipment for China's digital synchronous network typically includes dedicated multi-channel GPS receivers for communication; however, with the development of GPS by the USA, network security has been destabilized and reliability is low. Nonetheless, network time synchronization based on Beidou satellite navigation system timing devices is an inevitable development trend for China's digital communications network with the establishment of the independently developed BDS, especially the implementation and improvement of the Beidou foundation enhancement system.",
